# Loan Status Prediction Model

**Overview:**
This repository houses a machine learning model designed to predict loan status using three distinct algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. The project aims to assist financial institutions in evaluating and predicting the likelihood of loan approval for applicants based on relevant features.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree algorithms for loan status prediction.
- Provides a comprehensive analysis of model performance through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Includes data preprocessing steps to handle missing values, feature scaling, and categorical encoding.
- Offers a user-friendly interface to input applicant information and receive instant loan status predictions.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.

**Contributing:**
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests.
